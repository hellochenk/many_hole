## What is a fiber?

<details>
<summary>我们要讨论 react fiber 架构的核心，Fibers 是一个非常低等级的抽象-比开发者通常思考的还要低。如果你发现自己在理解它的努力中受挫，别沮丧。坚持下去最终会有意义。
（当你最终搞定它时，请提议如何改进它）</summary>
<pre>
We're about to discuss the heart of React Fiber's architecture. Fibers are a much lower-level abstraction than application developers typically think about. If you find yourself frustrated in your attempts to understand it, don't feel discouraged. Keep trying and it will eventually make sense. (When you do finally get it, please suggest how to improve this section.)

Here we go!
